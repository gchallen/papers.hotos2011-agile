\section{Introduction}

Battery-powered devices are trapped by trends. More powerful performance
requires more power, battery technologies are improving
slowly~\cite{economist-batteryhistory}, and users want their devices to last
as long as they to today---or longer~\cite{informationweek-batteries}. A way
to escape this trap leverages power-proportional hardware
architectures~\cite{barroso-energyproportional} that scale performance and
power consumption to perform when needed and draw little power when idle.
Because most device components are tuned to operate efficiently within a
narrow power-performance range, we expect future power-proportional
architectures to be increasingly \textit{heterogeneous}: featuring multiple
different processors, memory banks, storage devices and radios, each
component embodying a particular power-performance tradeoff. Heterogeneity
produces single devices that can morph into many others: a phone that can
sprint like a laptop and sleep like a sensor node.

Today many devices already incorporate multiple processors, storage devices
and radios with different power-performance characteristics. Researchers have
proposed operating system designs acknowledging this
heterogeneity~\cite{baumann-barrelfish}, performance- or power-driven
component combinations~\cite{mogul-hybridnvmdram,aruna-3Gwifi}, approaches
harnessing the efficiency of a particular set of components for a certain
task~\cite{andersen-fawn,szalay-amdahl}, and systems organized into multiple
power-performance tiers~\cite{sorber-turducken}. Inspired by these efforts,
we introduce the term \textit{power agility} to describe the ability of a
system to operate a heterogeneous power-proportional device balancing
performance and power consumption.

Given increasingly heterogeneous devices, power agility requires not merely
adjusting individual components but activating and deactivating them to react
to changes in demand caused by variations in device usage. The idle phone in
my pocket consumes less power than the one routing me to my destination, and
while the mapping application wants the high-power radio, the game prefers a
faster processor. So while power-proportional \textit{hardware} allows the
device to sprint and sleep, power-agile \textit{software} guides it nimbly
between states in response to demand. We consider microarchitectural attempts
to mask power fluctuations~\cite{rangan-hpca11} from the OS a mistake. Only
the operating system has enough information---from user priorities to a view
of all running processes---to achieve power agility.

This paper outlines the principles of power-agile computing. First, we
construct a heterogeneous power-proportional device illustrating the size and
diversity of the state space inherent to these architectures. Next, we
present a scenario demonstrating our device responding to changes in demand.
Using this scenario, we develop a set of challenges inherent to power-agile
operation and discuss approaches to overcoming them.
