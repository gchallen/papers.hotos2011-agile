\section{Introduction}

\XXXnote{GWA: TODO: FIXME.} Throughout the rest of the proposal we refer to a
\textit{component ensemble} as the set of components active at a given time,
constraining the possible ensembles to consist of (a) at least one or
multiple processors and memory chips and (b) zero, one or multiple storage
devices or radios\footnote{While many low-power processors come with small
amounts of integrated memory, we have conservatively chosen to require 32~MB
of RAM in order to run embedded versions of Linux. It is conceivable that our
candidate device could enter an active sleep state with a micro-kernel
capable of fitting in the processor's onboard RAM.}. Using the components
