0 & With no tasks to process, \textbf{P1} and \textbf{M1} are idle, while
\textbf{R1} operates at low duty cycle awaiting incoming tasks.

Alerted to an incoming task, the device activates \textbf{R2} to rapidly
receive task data and \textbf{S1} to store it.
\\

2 &
When processing begins, energy usage is reconfigured by activating
\textbf{P2} and disabling \textbf{R2}.
\\

3 &
Responding to a spike in availability, task processing is accelerated by
activating \textbf{M2} and mirroring to \textbf{S2}.

As results start being written to disk, power usage shifts within the same
component ensemble.
\\

When availability drops to 1~W, the device stores compressed results on
\textbf{S1}.
\\

To return results, \textbf{R3} is activated and driven using \textbf{P1}.
\\

7 &
When power availability falls again, the device disables \textbf{M3} and
switches to the smaller memory chip \textbf{M1}.
\\

8 &
Processing is complete.
