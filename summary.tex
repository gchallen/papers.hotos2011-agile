\section{Summary}

We have argued that new hardware trends towards power-proportional
heterogeneous devices demand operating system support to enable
power-agility: the ability of a system to operate these diverse devices
balancing performance and power efficiency. After constructing an example
power-proportional device, we illustrated its use using a scenario, and used
the scenario to motivate a set of research challenges that must be
investigated in order to develop power-agile systems.
