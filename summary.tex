\section{Summary}

Power-proportional heterogeneous devices demand operating system support to
achieve power-agility: the ability to operate these devices balancing
performance and power efficiency. Given the constraints facing
battery-powered devices, we consider power-agility critical to continued
performance improvements, and have outlined the challenges on the road to
power-agile computing.
