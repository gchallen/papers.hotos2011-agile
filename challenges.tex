\section{Principles of Agility}

Based on the observations in the previous section we formulate four
principles of power-agile systems --- balance, coordination, speed and
reflexes. This section presents each principle and discuss it in the context
of the operating system's role in preparing for, selecting, and executing
ensemble transitions.
