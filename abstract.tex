\subsection*{Abstract}

A growing class of battery-powered consumer devices are trapped between two
trends: users' desire for better performance, and the slow pace of
improvements in battery technology. To respond to this challenge, hardware
architectures are becoming more power proportional --- able to scale their
performance and power consumption across a wide range. But these abilities
will not be effectively utilized without system support. This paper
introduces the term \textit{power agility} to describe the capability of a
system to quickly and correctly adjust power proportional hardware as power
demand or availability change. Using a sample architecture and scenario we
develop the principles behind power-agile computing and outline the systems
challenges inherent to its realization.
