\section{Example Architecture}

To begin, we assemble a heterogeneous power-proportional device combining two
general-purpose processors\footnote{Distinguished from task-specific
processors like GPUs or DSPs.}, two memory chips, two storage devices and two
radios. Table~\ref{table-components} presents the components we selected.

The relationship between power and performance varies for each component.
Processors may transition smoothly over a restricted power envelope using
DVFS, but cannot scale to zero due to leakage current. DRAM memory 
chips have a
constant refresh cost scaling roughly with capacity plus additional power draw
corresponding to the rate of reads and writes. Storage devices differ based on whether or not they include
spinning components. Flash drives do not and scale approximately with usage
but are limited in size. Radios may exhibit even more power-performance
variation because their power usage depends both on the hardware and the
protocol. 802.11 clients can enter power-saving mode (PSM) which uses base
station buffering to save power. Bluetooth has limited range but lower power
consumption balanced between both sides of the link.

We define a \textit{component ensemble} as the set of components currently
active, constraining the set of valid ensembles to include only ones that can
support the device operating system. For our example, these include (a) one
or both processors, (b) one or both memory chips\footnote{While many
low-power processors come with small amounts of integrated memory, we have
conservatively chosen to require 32~MB of RAM in order to run embedded
versions of Linux. It is conceivable that our candidate device could enter an
active sleep state with a micro-kernel capable of fitting in the processor's
onboard RAM.}, (c) zero, one or both storage devices and (d) zero, one or
both radios. By switching between components our device can operate across a
wide power range. It its lowest-power ensemble, the device has a 75~MHz CPU,
32~MB of RAM, and draws 82~mW\footnote{Actual power consumption would be
higher due to system buses, memory controllers, and other components of a
complete architecture.} and is roughly-equivalent to a embedded sensor node.
In its highest-power ensemble the device has multiple cores, over 1~GB of
RAM, over 320~GB of storage, Wifi and Bluetooth. Consuming almost 2.5~W, it
is similar to emerging smartphones.

\caption{\small \textbf{Power envelopes of all 144 example device component
ensembles.} Ensembles are sorted by increasing maximum power draw. For each
ensemble, the bottom shows which components are active and the top displays
the power envelope. The top 80\% of the envelope---the most efficient
operating range---is drawn in dark blue. The right axis counts the total
number of ensembles that might draw that much power: e.g., there are 121
ensembles that could consume 0.75~W, depending on the workload.}

This device can activate \textit{144 valid component ensembles}\footnote{3
processor choices $\times$ 3 memory choices $\times$ 4 storage choices
$\times$ 4 radio choices.}. Figure~\ref{figure-componentgraph} shows the
composition and power envelope of all ensembles, and motivates two
observations. First, there is wide variation in the power usage of component
ensembles even in an architecture with only two components per class.
Incorporating more components would produce even more options. Second, at any
power level there are many diverse components ensembles the device can use: a
fast processor, small memory chip, and slow disk; a slow processor, large
memory, and a fast radio; etc. These differ not in their total power
consumption but in how they distribute power and performance across
components, and while some ensembles may seem too weird to be useful they may
suit certain applications. Finally, while it may seem best to avoid
inefficient ensembles---those achieving low utilization and a low active- to
idle-power ratio---given the speed of temporal changes in demand and the
overhead of ensemble transitions we expect devices to spend some time at the
low end of ensemble power envelopes.
